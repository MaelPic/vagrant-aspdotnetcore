# vagrant-aspdotnetcore

Simple Vagrant file that will help you having up and running ASP .NET application on a Linux box. Uses Docker files created by default with VS2017.

It was tested with simple default project created in Visual Studio 2017 when doing "File"->"New"->"Project...", select .NET Core/ASP.NET Core Web Application and then select Web API with "Enable Docker Support" ticked and OS = Linux.
